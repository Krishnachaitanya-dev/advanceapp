## ⚠️ **IMPORTANT NOTES**

### Location Permission Best Practices
- The app now shows explanation BEFORE requesting location permission
- Users can choose "Enter Manually" to avoid location sharing
- Location is only requested when app is active (foreground)
- No background location tracking implemented

### Data Privacy Compliance
- All user data encrypted in transit using HTTPS
- Personal information used only for service delivery
- Location data not permanently stored
- Users can delete their accounts and data

### Testing Recommendations
1. Test location permission flow on fresh install
2. Verify manual address entry works without location
3. Test app behavior when location permission denied
4. Confirm privacy policy and terms are accessible
